This folder contains a passion project of mine: 
Creating a machine learning model which generates custom text for cards from my favorite digital card game: Hearthstone.

Hearthstone Card Generator RNN.ipynb
	This file contains the code for creating the model and teaching it.
	I used a tutorial from tensorflow as a basis for the code. 

Card Generator DCGAN.ipynb
	This file contains the code for failed initial attempt at creating the model. 
	Originally, I tried converting a GAN to work on text instead of images.
	I highlight my process of experimenting and what I learned in my presentation.

GAN & RNN.pptx
CollinCardGeneratorPresentation.m4a
	I had the opportunity to present on my project to a group of SDSU peers.
	I described two types of models (GANs & RNNs) as well as my process of designing the machine learning model.
	I have included the powerpoint from my presentation as well as a recording of a practice presentation.
